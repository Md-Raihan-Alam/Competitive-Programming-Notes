Assume we have four number a,b,c,d. Check whether a|b==c|d and if not then how many steps you need to make them equal assuming one step is multiply numerator or denominator of any integer
of our choice
we always can make fractions equal in two operations: Multiply first fraction's enumerator by bc, the first fraction is equal to abc/b=ac, Multiply second fraction's 
enumerator by ad, the second fraction is equal to acd/d=ac.

That means that the answer does not exceed 2.

If fractions are equal from input, the answer is 0. Otherwise, it can't be 0.

Now we have to check if the answer is 1. Let's assume that for making fractions equal in 1 operation we have to multiply first fraction's enumerator by x. 
Then ax/b=cd must be true. From this we can see that x=bc/ad. x must be integer, so bc must be divisible by ad. If we assume that we multiplied first fraction's denumerator by x,
 we can do the same calculations and see that ad must be divisible by bc. So, for checking if the answer is 1 we need to check if one of ad and bc is divisible by another one. 
If we multiply second fraction's enumerator or denumerator by x we will get the same conditions for answer being equla to 1.
